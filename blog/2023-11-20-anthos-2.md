![Anthos in Google Cloud](img/anthos-4.jpg)

In this second installment of the Anthos series, we will talk about how we run
Anthos in [Kartverket](https://kartverket.no/en). We'll touch on the hardware,
the software, and the processes we use to keep it running.

By the end we hope that we'll have de-mystified Anthos a bit, and maybe given
you an idea of what it takes to run Anthos in production.

If you haven't read the first part, you can find it
[here](/blog/hybrid-kubernetes-in-production-part-1).
