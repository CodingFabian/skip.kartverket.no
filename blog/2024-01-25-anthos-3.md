In this final installment of the Anthos series, we will talk about what we
learned on the way to building hybrid infrastructure at [Kartverket](https://kartverket.no/en). 

If you haven't read the other parts, you can find the first part
[here](/blog/hybrid-kubernetes-in-production-part-1).

<!--truncate-->

- Think if you really need hybrid or just need to mature your org for the cloud
- Hybrid gives your organization flexibility
- Abstractions are needed
- Service mesh is hard
- Anthos helps you as a platform team getting started with best practices, even if you plan to move to open source components later
- Autoscaling can be an issue if licenses bill per node
- Plan on using managed services? Check if they are supported on-premise
